## 1. Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial NLP task that identifies and classifies named entities in text, including names, organizations, locations, and more. It plays a vital role in various applications like information retrieval, question answering, translation, sentiment analysis, and summarization. The main objective of NER is to precisely recognize and categorize named entities present in a text. This process entails two essential steps: detecting the boundaries of the entities, which involves identifying the starting and ending positions of the named entities and classifying the entities by assigning a predetermined label or category to each one. For example, in the sentence "Elon Musk has a plan to go to Mars." NER would classify "Elon Musk" as a person and "Mars" as a location.


NER is important because it enables machines to understand and extract meaningful information from unstructured text. By identifying named entities, NER helps in organizing and structuring textual data, which can be further used for various downstream tasks. For example, in information retrieval systems, NER can improve search results by allowing users to search for specific entities. In question-answering systems, NER helps in identifying the entities relevant to the question. In sentiment analysis, recognizing named entities can provide additional context to determine the sentiment expressed towards them.


Nevertheless, the NER task has several challenges. One major difficulty is that named entities can be ambiguous and vary in different contexts. For example, the word "Jaguar" can refer to an animal or a company. To solve these ambiguities, we need a deep understanding of the context and general knowledge. Additionally, named entities can have complex structures like compound names or nested entities, which makes their detection and classification more difficult. Another challenge in NER is the lack of labeled training data. Annotated datasets are often limited, especially for specialized domains or languages. Collecting and labeling large-scale datasets for NER can be time-consuming and expensive. This scarcity of labeled data can affect the performance of NER models, especially for less common or emerging entities.


In this project, I will explore two approaches for the NER problem: the CRF (Conditional Random Fields)  as a machine learning model and using the Transformers as a deep learning model. I aim to enhance the performance of these models by addressing the challenges they encounter and finding effective solutions. By studying and improving these approaches, I hope to contribute to the advancement of NER technology and its applications in natural language processing.
